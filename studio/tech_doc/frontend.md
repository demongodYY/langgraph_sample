Of course. Here is a frontend project document based on a React tech stack.

## 1\. Architecture

We will adopt a **Feature-Based Component Architecture**. This approach organizes the codebase by feature (e.g., `products`, `auth`, `cart`), making it scalable and easy to navigate. Each feature directory is self-contained, holding its own components, state logic, and styles. This is supplemented by a `shared` directory for truly reusable elements across the entire application.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph App Entry
        A[main.tsx]
    end

    subgraph Core
        B[App.tsx]
        C[Router]
        D[Global State/Provider]
    end

    subgraph Features
        E["Feature A <br/> (e.g., UserProfile)"]
        F["Feature B <br/> (e.g., Dashboard)"]
    end

    subgraph Shared
        G["Components <br/> (Button, Input, Modal)"]
        H["Hooks <br/> (useDebounce, useLocalStorage)"]
        I["Services <br/> (api.ts)"]
        J["Layouts <br/> (MainLayout)"]
    end

    A --> B
    B --> C
    B --> D
    C --> E
    C --> F
    C --> J

    E -- "Uses" --> G
    F -- "Uses" --> G
    E -- "Uses" --> H
    F -- "Uses" --> H
    E -- "Uses" --> I
    F -- "Uses" --> I

    style E fill:#cce5ff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style F fill:#cce5ff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style G fill:#d4edda,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style H fill:#d4edda,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style I fill:#f8d7da,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style J fill:#d4edda,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

### Component Breakdown

- **Features**: These are the main sections of your application (e.g., `auth`, `userProfile`, `products`). Each feature folder contains all related files: components, custom hooks, and feature-specific state logic.
- **Shared/Common Components**: This directory holds **reusable, "dumb" UI components** like `Button`, `Input`, `Card`, and `Modal`. They are presentation-focused and receive data via props.
- **Services/API**: Contains the logic for all **external communication**, primarily with the backend REST API. We'll use a centralized client (like Axios) to handle requests, responses, and error handling.
- **Hooks**: A collection of **reusable custom hooks** that can be used across different features (e.g., `useDebounce`, `useClickOutside`).
- **State Management**: This involves managing data that needs to be shared across the application. We'll use a combination of local state, global state, and server state management.
- **Layouts**: Components that define the main structure of a page, such as a header, footer, and sidebar (`MainLayout`, `AuthLayout`).

## 3\. General Coding Rules

Adherence to these rules ensures our codebase is consistent, readable, and maintainable.

### Naming & Structure

- **Folders**: Use `kebab-case` for feature folders (e.g., `user-profile`).
- **Components**: Use `PascalCase` for component files (e.g., `UserProfile.tsx`).
- **Hooks**: Prefix custom hooks with `use` and name with `camelCase` (e.g., `useUserData.ts`).
- **File Structure**: Each component should be in its own file. For components with associated styles or tests, create a folder for them (e.g., `/Button/index.tsx`, `/Button/Button.test.tsx`).

### Component Design

- **Functional Components**: Exclusively use functional components with hooks.
- **Props**: Use **TypeScript interfaces** to define component props for type safety.
- **Composition**: Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility. Create larger, complex UIs by composing smaller components together.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Separate logic (hooks) from presentation (JSX). A component should ideally focus on rendering UI based on its props and state.

### State Management

- **Local State (`useState`)**: Use for state that is only relevant to a single component (e.g., form input values, modal visibility).
- **Global State (Redux Toolkit)**: Use for state that is shared across many components and features (e.g., authentication status, user information, theme).
- **Server State (RTK Query)**: Use for all data fetched from the backend. This handles caching, re-fetching, and loading/error states automatically. **Do not store server data in the global Redux store.**

### Best Practices

- **API Calls**: Centralize all API fetching logic within the **services/API layer** and expose it through RTK Query endpoints. Components should not make direct `fetch` or `axios` calls.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Keep JSX clean. For complex conditional logic, use helper functions or move the logic outside the `return` statement.
- **Keys**: Always provide a stable and unique `key` prop when rendering lists of elements.
- **Testing**: Write tests for custom hooks and complex utility functions. Write integration tests for components to verify they render correctly and respond to user interaction.
- **Accessibility (a11y)**: Write semantic HTML and use ARIA attributes where necessary to ensure the application is usable by everyone.
